#+TITLE: Org Roam

* What is it?

[[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Introduction][Org-roam]] is a solution, built on org-mode, to capture notes in a non-hierarchical way.

Notes can relate to each other, creating a web of relations. It helps you implement a digital [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]] slip box of notes.

* What can you use it for

With org-roam, you can create your own wiki, powered by Emacs, org-mode features.

Org-roam helps you search, link to other notes, and also has a graphical view (using graphviz) of the relations between your notes.

* Getting started

Have a look at the Org-roam [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Getting-Started][Getting Started]] page.

The main actions you will perform:
 1. create new notes (uses org-roam's own [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#The-Templating-System][org-capture templates]]). Command org-roam-find-file on a new title.
 2. search notes by name / tags. Command org-roam-find-file
 3. create links to existing notes (manually, or using auto [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Completions][completion]] frameworks)
 4. use any features of org mode you like (tables, source code block, bibliography, etc..)

* Hints

** You can't find your notes, or they are not named properly

Org-roam indexes your notes, and it's possible that the index was not created yet, or is out of sync.

You can solve this problem in couple of ways:
 1. make sure you followed the getting started steps to setup indexing, the after-init-hook and the update method
 2. If your configuration is correct, but you still have an issue
    1. you have a wrongly named entry in your search, clear and rebuild your cache with the following commands (M-x):
       #+begin_src
       org-roam-db-clear-cache
       org-roam-db-build-cache
       #+end_src
    2. you are missing some entry, build the cache manually with the following command (M-x):
       `org-roam-db-build-cache`

** Renaming notes

Renaming titles within your note has an impact to the search. Make sure the index has the original name before changing a title. This is usually done by saving your note (C-c C-c, and possibly C-x C-s).

Without the note properly indexed, the changes will not be visible in the org-roam-find-file command.


** Want different colors for org-roam links vs other links?

To get some visual queue about regular links vs org-roam links, you can set a different color for org-roam links like here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noeval
(custom-set-faces
  '((org-roam-link org-roam-link-current)
    :foreground "#e24888" :underline t))
#+end_src
